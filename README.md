# Expectation vs. Reality Index (ERI)

The Expectation vs. Reality Index (ERI) is an independent evaluation framework designed to measure the gap between documented expectations and observed outcomes in consumer and service experiences.

ERI does not provide recommendations, endorsements, or rankings.
It documents measurable discrepancies using a neutral, repeatable methodology.

Current scope includes fashion commerce.
Future extensions will be published through formal versions.
